## About the Project

This repository contains various Java programs and exercises aimed at demonstrating my skills and understanding of Java programming. The project covers a wide range of topics, including:

- **Algorithm and Data Structures**
- **Java Language Fundamentals**
- **Control Structures**
- **Classes, Objects, Methods**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction**
- **Lambdas**
- **Stream API**
- **Exception Handling**
- **JavaFX**
- **Relational Databases**
- **NoSQL Databases**
- **JPA (Hibernate)**
- **Spring Boot**

## Features

- **Algorithm and Data Structures:** Implementation of common algorithms and data structures.
- **Java Fundamentals:** Basic syntax, data types, variables, and operators.
- **Control Structures:** Examples of conditionals, loops, and other control flow mechanisms.
- **Classes and Objects:** Demonstrations of creating classes, objects, and utilizing constructors.
- **OOP Principles:** Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction in practice.
- **Lambdas and Stream API:** Functional programming features in Java.
- **Exception Handling:** Techniques for handling exceptions and creating custom exceptions.
- **JavaFX:** Building GUI applications with JavaFX.
- **Database Integration:** Working with relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) databases.
- **JPA and Hibernate:** Using JPA with Hibernate for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
- **Spring Boot:** Creating RESTful web services and microservices with Spring Boot.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 17:** The main programming language used in this project.
- **JUnit:** For writing and running unit tests.
- **Maven/Gradle:** For project management and dependency management.
- **JavaFX:** For building graphical user interfaces.
- **Spring Boot:** For developing web applications and microservices.
- **Hibernate:** For object-relational mapping (ORM).
- **PostgreSQL/MongoDB:** For relational and NoSQL database management.
